# Email_AI_Assistant
use the “Enron Email Dataset” to build a system that can either summarize long email threads or generate responses to common emails. 
The goal is to explore the capabilities of a generative language model to handle everyday email tasks. 
Dataset: Open-source dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-emaildataset

Scenario:

Your company wants to automate part of its email workflow by using AI to either summarize long
email threads or generate responses for common email types.

Objective:

• Create a pipeline using a pre-trained language model to perform one of the following tasks:
  1. Summarize long email threads.
  2. Generate automated responses to common email types.
